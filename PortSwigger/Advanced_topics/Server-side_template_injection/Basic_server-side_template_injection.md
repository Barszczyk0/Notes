# Basic server-side template injection
# Objective
This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the unsafe construction of an `ERB` template.

To solve the lab, review the `ERB` documentation to find out how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the `morale.txt` file from Carlos's home directory.

# Solution
## Analysis
After clicking the first item, user receives information (message) that the selected item is out of stock. The description of this lab informs that there is a `EDB` template in use. The `message` parameter is vulnerable to Server-side template injection.
