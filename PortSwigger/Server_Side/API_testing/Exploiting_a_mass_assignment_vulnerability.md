# Exploiting a mass assignment vulnerability
# Objective
To solve the lab, find and exploit a mass assignment vulnerability to buy a Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`. 

To solve this lab, you'll need to know:
- What mass assignment is.
- Why mass assignment may result in hidden parameters.
- How to identify hidden parameters.
- How to exploit mass assignment vulnerabilities.


# Solution
